inverse in shader is bold

yes
layout(location = 6) uniform vec3 viewPos; is also not required as you already have that information stored inside your layout(location = 1) uniform mat4 view;

yeah just extract the view pos from the matrix
view[3].xyz

This matrix uniform mat4 view; is inverted.
it's the inverse of the camera transform
you could pass the actual camera transform instead
and precompute the VP matrix, which is what I'd do
